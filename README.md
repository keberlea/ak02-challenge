# ak02-challenge

## Description

This repository was made with a goal to optimize a marketing agency's, Horiseon, website for search engines.This repoository was built in order to make changes to the code without affecting the live website. The new code follows semantic HTML, a logical structure, accessible alt attributes, heading attributes that fall in sequential order and a descriptive title element. By condensing the CSS codes and editing the html file the new website for the customer will folllow accessibility rules to a greater extent while stimutaniously improvising visibility in search engines when their customers are searching. A lot of benefit is provided in having a more consice code when it comes to others working through the code at later times.
